Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes relationships, trends, and distributions in the data.
Model Building: Implements machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer data.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
Dependencies
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Instructions
Open the Notebook: Load the breast_cancer.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Load Dataset: Ensure the appropriate breast cancer dataset is available in the required format (e.g., CSV).
Run Cells: Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, perform analysis, and build models.
Use Cases
Medical Research: Helps in understanding breast cancer data for research purposes.
Educational Purposes: Demonstrates data science techniques for machine learning beginners.
Healthcare Applications: Serves as a starting point for developing tools to aid diagnosis.
